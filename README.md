# Who's Me
i am amal vinod, i was born and brought up in allapuzha,kerala. My answer why i chose amrita os because it provides a wide opportunity for computer engineering aspirants.
i dont have that a strong computer background, but i have learned a bit of c++ programming but i am not a pro at it also. i have a strong interest towards computer technologies and coding which attracted me towards foss.In this modern era to survive knowledge about computer and latest technologies is a must.my cousin is the one who created a attraction towards coding and technologies,he was working at microsoft initislly from  where he resigned and joined the senses technology as the southern technological director . i decided to apply for foss because it provides me a better platform to improvise my coding and developing skills.i have a urge to learn more about coding and developing which i believe that by joining foss i would be able to achieve that.
