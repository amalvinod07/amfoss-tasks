This is Amal Vinod, fresher at amrita school of engineering(CSE 2020)
# Who's Me
I am Amal Vinod, I was born and brought up in allapuzha,Kerala. My answer why I chose amrita is because it provides a wide opportunity for computer engineering aspirants.
I dont have that a strong computer background, but I have learned a bit of c++ programming but I am not a pro at it also. I have a strong interest towards computer technologies and coding which attracted me towards foss.In this modern era to survive knowledge about computer and latest technologies is a must.My cousin is the one who created a attraction towards coding and technologies,he was working at microsoft initislly from  where he resigned and joined the senses technology as the southern technological director . I decided to apply for foss because it provides me a better platform to improvise my coding and developing skills.I have a urge to learn more about coding and developing which I believe that by joining foss I would be able to achieve that.
