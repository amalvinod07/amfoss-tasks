# why must we choose you
i have a strong urge to improvise my skills and bring name for my platform from where i learned. i will give my 100% for foss . i had heard from many of my cousins who were a passout from amrita suggesting that amfoss would help me improvise my knowledge and develop my skills to a great extent. i am a person who believes in effort rather than result and i will give my 100% effort for the development of club. if we give our 100% effort results will automatically follow. since there are more experienced seniors who shine in different fields i seek this chance to learn from them 
# what is your plan for next six months
i want to learn maximum languages and programs that i can and want to get a cgpa of 8.5 above and to develop something for our society
# how would you contribute back to club
as i mentioned earlier i am a person who believes in effort rather than results. if we give 100% efforts results will follow. i will share the knowledge with those people who seek and help them in whatever way i can and will help in the bright future of our club in upcoming years
# do you have any feedback for selection process
no i am not a person who can tell about the selection process to this prestigious club because i have a little computer background and people who are in the cabinet of selection is far more experienced than me, but after a year or so i would be able to help the club selection by guiding them to correct people
